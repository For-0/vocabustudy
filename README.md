## What is Nightly?

Vocabustudy's nightly build includes new, not-yet-released experimental features and design elements which have not yet been fully tested and launched. Although we try to make sure our nightly builds have no bugs, a few are sure to sneak in! We recommend you study on the main website, or [here.](https://www.vocabustudyonline.web.app/)
