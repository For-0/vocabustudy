## What is Nightly?

[Vocabustudy's nightly build](https://nightly.vocabustudy.org/) includes new, not-yet-released experimental features and design elements which have not yet been fully tested and launched. Although we try to make sure our nightly builds have no bugs, a few are sure to sneak in! We recommend you study on the main website, or [here.](https://vocabustudy.org/)
