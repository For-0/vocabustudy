                    |
                    ol There are some guidelines for sets:
                        li Your sets cannot have offensive, harmful, or explict content. 
                         | If we find your content to match one of these descriptions, your set will at the very least be made private or deleted, and at worst, your account will be restricted.
                        |
                        li Try to keep sets relevant. If you wish to make a joke set, say that it is a joke in the description.
                        |
                        li Vocabustudy Admins have the right to view your private sets, as well as make edits to (or even delete) your existing sets.
                    |
                    p Have fun making useful sets!
